## Overview of project stack .

Mojaloop is an open-source platform that provides a framework for interoperable digital payments. It is built using modern technologies and is designed to be scalable, flexible, and customizable. It uses the ISO 20022 standard for financial messaging and supports a variety of payment types, including person-to-person, merchant payments, and bill payments. The platform is developed using Node.js and runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including virtual machines, storage, databases, and analytics. It supports a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD. Azure provides a reliable and scalable infrastructure for running applications and services, and it includes built-in security and compliance features.

ReactNative is a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it to both Android and iOS devices. ReactNative uses a combination of JavaScript and native code to create high-performance mobile apps with a native look and feel. It includes a large number of pre-built UI components and third-party libraries, which makes it easy to develop complex mobile applications quickly.

BaaS (Backend as a Service) tools are a set of cloud-based services that provide developers with the infrastructure and tools needed to build and run backend services for their applications. These services include authentication, data storage, analytics, and messaging. BaaS tools simplify the development process by handling many of the infrastructure and operational tasks, allowing developers to focus on building the application logic.

Convex.dev is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) database that provides a simple and intuitive way to store and retrieve data. It supports a variety of data types, including text, numbers, and dates, and it includes features like indexing and query optimization to ensure fast and efficient data retrieval.

Cleck.dev is an authentication service that provides secure account creation and management. It includes features like password hashing, two-factor authentication, and social login integration, which makes it easy for developers to add authentication to their applications.

The backend is built using TypeScript, a popular programming language that adds static type checking and other features to JavaScript. TypeScript makes it easier to write and maintain large-scale applications and provides a better developer experience by catching errors at compile time instead of at runtime.
